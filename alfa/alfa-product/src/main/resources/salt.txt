If you are having problems paying your loan on the repayment date you will need to speak to our 
customer service staff. In certain circumstances and where we feel it appropriate our staff will help 
you work out a repayment plan which could involve giving you an extension period. The extension 
period can be for 7, 14 or 30 days but no longer. If this happens we want you to know ‘upfront’ 
what the cost of an extension will be. If we grant you an extension we will not continue to charge you interest. We will simply give you a new repayment date and you will have to pay an advance extension fee to cover the period. To see what your extension fee might be if you are granted this option just use the sliders on the home page to choose your loan amount and when your repayment date.
